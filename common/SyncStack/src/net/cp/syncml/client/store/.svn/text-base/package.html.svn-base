    The package defining a local record store and its capabilities. <br/><br/>

    This provides the SyncML client with the ability to access (possibly multiple) local record stores
    and to sync them with a remote SyncML server. <br/><br/>

    Users of this SyncML client must first implement the {@link net.cp.syncml.client.store.RecordStore RecordStore} 
    and {@link net.cp.syncml.client.store.Record Record} interfaces from this package before using the client.

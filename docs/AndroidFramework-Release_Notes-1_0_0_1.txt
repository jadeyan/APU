Release Summary
===============
Drop of Phone Backup Client v1.0.0.1

This is the first drop of this client.
It contains all the functionality specified in Android-framework-FS-v1.5.doc.
This drop is roughly based on the smartphone PRD.
The client contains:

A test UI, allowing a sync to be initiated manually, and offering feedback on sync sessions.
Server Initiated Sync, including support for vendor specific text.
Client Initiated Sync, whereby a change to the native addressbook can initiate a sync session.
Default nonce support.


Known Issues in this Release
============================
The included UI is a test UI, and only presents the functionality necessary to test the framework.

The syncML server needs to be updated to properly handle the ADDR field. The address is stored as a freeform string on the device, 
which has to be converted to/form a structed string array during sync. Addresses cannot be properly synced until the server is updated.

The name field is stored on the device as a freeform string, which has to be converted to/from a structed string array during sync.
Complex or unusual names may not maintain their structure after being synced with the device.

If the client is configured to sync automatically with no prompt, then there will be no visual feedback when a sync is in progress.

The client currently does not support upgrades.

Device Limitations
==================
None.


Install Instructions
====================
To install the application for use with CP Download Manager, perform the following steps:
    1. Expand the "CP_AndroidFramework-1_0_0_1-Android-Cupcake.tar.gz" package into the Download Manager web application folder. For example:
           /opt/criticalpath/tomcat/webapps/cp/download
    2. Edit the "<WebAppsDir>/cp/WEB-INF/etc/dm-devices-conf.xml" file and ensure that the "cfg" parameter of the 
       "location" tag of the "downloader" element points to the "features.properties" file. For example:
            <downloaders>
                ...
                <downloader name='pbc-android-1.0.0.1-downloader'
                plugin='net.cp.ps.dm.business.downloader.PhoneBackupAndroidDownloader' 
                downloadable='true'>
                    <location cfg='pbc-android-1.0.0.1/cfg/features.properties' />
	        </downloader>
                ...
            </downloaders>
    3. Expand the device-specific "CP_Phone_Backup-<Manufacturer>-<Model>.tar.gz" package into the folder.
    4. Edit the "<WebAppsDir>/cp/WEB-INF/etc/dm-devices-conf.xml" file and ensure that the "bin", "ad" and "cfg" 
       parameters of the corresponding "device" element points to the correct locations. Also ensure that the "name" of 
       the "client" element is identical to the application folder name (e.g. "phone-backup"). For example:
            <devices>
                ...
                <device user_agent="Android 1.5" id="AndroidCupcake" mfg="Android" model="Cupcake" display-name="Android 1.5 (Cupcake)" >

		    <client name='pbc-android-1.0.0.1' version='1.0.0' display='1.0.0 Android' type='pbc-android'>
				<download downloader='pbc-android-1.0.0.1-downloader' >
					<location bin='pbc-android-1.0.0.1/bin/CP_Phone_Backup-Android-Cupcake.apk'
						  ad='pbc-android-1.0.0.1/ad/CP_Phone_Backup-Android-Cupcake.ad' />
				</download>
			</client>
		</device>
                ...
            </devices>
    5. Edit the "<WebAppsDir>/cp/dm/WEB-INF/assets/<CoS>/<Language>/DM.xml" asset file(s) and ensure that they contain 
       all the assets needed to localize the Phone Backup Client AD files. For convenience, these assets can be found
       in the "<WebAppsDir>/cp/dm/phone-backup/dm/DM_en.xml" file - copy the assets from this file an place them in 
       the deployed "DM.xml" file(s) (replacing any assets with the same name that might already exist there). If any
       "DM.xml" file has been modified, you must restart the web server for the changes to be applied.

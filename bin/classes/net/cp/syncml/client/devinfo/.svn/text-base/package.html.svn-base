    The package dealing with the definition of a device and its associated capabilities. <br/><br/>

    This device information is necessary so that the SyncML client can provide it to the SyncML server
    during a sync session. <br/><br/>

    Users of this SyncML client must first implement the {@link net.cp.syncml.client.devinfo.Device Device}, 
    interface from this package before using the client.

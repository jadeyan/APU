</p>
<br></br>

                        <p><strong>Bluebook Terms of Use <br /> General </strong></p>
 <p> These terms and conditions set out  the rules which apply to your use of the Bluebook service (the &quot;Service&quot;).  You should ensure that you read these terms and conditions carefully as your  use in any way of the Service constitutes your agreement to all terms,  conditions, and notices contained or referenced herein. You also agree to be  bound by the general terms and conditions located at <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/termsconditions/webwapandimode" title="Terms and conditions">www.o2.co.uk/termsconditions/webwapandimode</a>, including in particular  those related to User Generated Content. By accessing and/or using the Service  you confirm that you are a UK resident. If you do not agree to these Terms of  Use please do not use this Service.</p>
 <p> We reserve the right to review and  revise our terms and conditions from time to time without giving you prior  notice and by using the Service subsequent to any revision of our terms and  conditions, you agree to be bound by such changes.</p>

 <p>These terms apply to all elements of  the O2 Bluebook Service: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Your  Contacts will be stored for 18 months from the date of your last Backup. </li>
  <li>O2 retains  sole discretion to determine whether you will be given an online account for  the Service. Without an online account you cannot use the Service. </li>
  <li>If your  mobile phone is disconnected from the O2 network, you will not be able to use  the Service. Your account for the Service will be cancelled automatically. You  will still be able to access your on-line Address Book  at <a href="file:///D:\Eugenes_stuff\Data%20return\Design\Website\Screen%20copy\Bluebook%20Terms\www.o2.co.uk">www.o2.co.uk</a>. It is your responsibility  to ensure that you have taken a copy of the data prior to closing the account. </li>
</ul>
<p>You must tell O2 if you transfer your  mobile number to another user. If you do not then O2 cannot be held responsible  if the subsequent user of your mobile number gains access to your Contacts.</p>

 <p> <strong>Privacy Policy and Data Protection  consent </strong></p>
<p>  O2 is not responsible for the content  of the Service.</p>
 <p> Information which you provide as part  of the Service and other information which you may supply to O2 is subject to  the O2 Privacy Policy. The current version of the O2 Privacy Policy shall be  deemed incorporated into these Terms of Use. You can view the O2 Privacy Policy  here:<a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/termsconditions/o2privacypolicy" title="Privacy policy">http://www.o2.co.uk/termsconditions/o2privacypolicy</a></p>
 <p><strong>Termination of Service</strong></p>
  <p>O2 reserves the right to withdraw the  Service at any time provided we give you at least 30 days notice by email or  text message to the contact details provided by you to us. It is your  responsibility to ensure that the contact details we hold are up to date.</p>

  <p>Except as otherwise stated in the O2  Privacy Policy, O2 accepts no liability for the loss of data stored on the  Service.</p>
 <p> O2 can delete your account on the  Service if your account is deemed inactive. A Bluebook  account is deemed inactive where a customer  has not backed up or restored a Contact using the Service in the previous 18 month  period.</p>
 <p> O2 reserves the right to alter this  definition of “inactive” from time to time. O2 may also, in its sole  discretion, 'recycle' phone numbers (i.e. re-allocate a number which has  previously been used on the O2 network) and delete accounts for the Service  associated with such number.</p>
 <p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
  <p>These Terms of Use are governed by  English law. Both O2 and you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the  English courts.</p>

  <p><strong>Bluebook</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Description of Service</strong></p>
  <p>The Bluebook Service allows you to  store the contact details contained on your phone, and on your personal  computer if you are an O2 Broadband customer, (each a &quot;Contact&quot;) to  your address book on O2's portal at <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/" title="www.o2.co.uk">www.o2.co.uk</a> (your &quot;Address  Book&quot;). In these terms, we refer to the process that allows you to store  your Contacts in your Address Book as a &quot;Backup&quot;.</p>

<p>You are required to provide your own  equipment (mobile phone and computer) in order to use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Charges</strong></p>
  <p>There is no charge for backing up  your phone address book using Bluebook when you use the correct Internet  settings (also called APNs) on your phone. If you use the Mobile Web settings  however, you will be charged at your standard rate for accessing Internet  services on your mobile phone.</p>
  <p>If you lose your handset and keep  your mobile number, you will be able to restore your Contacts free of charge to  your new number when you activate your new Pay Monthly SIM. For Pay &amp; Go  SIMs, you will be able to restore the contacts free of charge only once your  existing mobile number has been ported to your new SIM - this may take up to  three (3) days. In both cases you'll need to have a phone handset supported by  the Service to restore your contacts on your new phone.</p>
<p>O2 reserve the right to charge, in  future, for this restoration service. Such charges will apply regardless of  when the O2 Contacts was set up. O2 will notify users before any charges are  introduced, such notification being made via the O2 Contacts website.</p>
<p>The following functionality is  provided by O2 without charge, as part of Bluebook:</p>
  <ul>

  <li>registration for Bluebook</li>
  <li>use of Bluebook services (although  note that you may be charged for Internet access by your Internet Service  Provider)</li>
  <li>use of the system and storage space</li>
  </ul>
<p>O2 reserve the right to charge, in  future, for the above services. O2 will notify users before any charges are  introduced. Customers who register for Bluebook during a period where no  charges are applicable will not subsequently be charged a registration fee even  if they continue to use O2 Bluebook after the end of the free period.</p>

 <p><strong>Advertising and Promotion</strong></p>

 <p>O2 runs advertisements and promotions  on user's Bluebooks. By creating a Bluebook account you agree that O2 has the  right to run such advertisements and promotions. You also agree that you will  not attempt to block or otherwise interfere with advertisements displayed on  your Bluebook. Doing so is grounds for immediate termination of service. The  manner, mode and extent of advertising by O2 on your Bluebook are subject to  change. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in  promotions of, advertisers found on or through the Service, including payment  and deliver of related goods or services, and any other terms, condition,  warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between  you and such advertiser. You agree that O2 shall not be responsible or liable  for any loss or damage or any sort incurred as the result of such dealings or  as the result of the presence of such advertisers on the Service.</p>
  <p><strong> Leaving O2</strong></p>
 <p> If you leave O2 you will no longer be able to add Contacts to your Bluebook. You will be able to view your existing Contacts and export them to a comma separated text file. </p>
   <p><strong>Transferring your mobile number</strong></p>
  <p>If you transfer your phone number to  someone else and do not want this person to access the contents of your  Bluebook account, it is your responsibility to delete the contents of your O2  Bluebook account and close it before transfer.</p>

  <p><strong>Viewing the contents of your account  with an Internet Browser</strong></p>
 <p> You accept the risk that it may be  possible for some of the content you view with an Internet Browser or WAP  Browser to be intercepted while being transmitted across the Internet between a  web browser or WAP browser and the Bluebook system.</p>

<p><strong>Backup via SyncML</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The  Service is only available if you have a SyncML  compatible handset, and if your handset is supported by the Service. Not all  SyncML phones are compatible with the Service. The Service will not work if you  subsequently change your handset to a non-SyncML compatible handset. </li>
  <li>The  Service can be used while abroad, subject to  international roaming agreements and applicable tariff charges. </li>

  <li>Customers  on the border in Republic of Ireland/Northern Ireland must select O2UK to be  able to use the  Service when  synchronising over GPRS WAP or GSM WAP. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business Customers Only </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Business  customers must inform O2 if the mobile number used by an employee who  registered for the Service is subsequently re-allocated to a different  employee. </li>
  <li>If an  employee leaves the company, the following steps must be taken:- <br clear="all">
  </li>
  <ul>

    <li>the mobile number associated  to the account on the Service must be changed (this can be done by registering  a new mobile number on o2.co.uk)<br clear="all">
      OR </li>
    <li>the account for the Service  for that mobile number should be closed. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Failure  to follow these steps means O2 cannot be held responsible if the subsequent  owner of your mobile number gains access to the previous owner's contacts. </li>
</ul>

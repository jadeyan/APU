<h1>What is Bluebook and how do I activate it?</h1>
<br>
<p>Bluebook allows you to backup all your phone contacts (this does not include SIM contacts), so you&#39;ll never lose touch with your friends. You’ll need an o2 mobile that is <A href="http://www.o2.co.uk/bluebookchecker">compatible</A>,  an o2.co.uk account and a phone setup in Bluebook. <BR><BR>If you have an O2 account you can register for Bluebook by visiting our homepage and entering your username and password and clicking “Sign in”. If you are already signed in then click “Join Bluebook” or “Visit Bluebook”. <BR><BR>If you don&#39;t have an o2.co.uk account you can register for one and join Bluebook by clicking on &#39; Join Bluebook&#39; from the Bluebook homepage. Here you will be asked to enter your mobile number and Bluebook will then send you a verification pin. On receipt of the pin enter it along with your personal details and select your phone to complete your registration.</p>
<br>


<h1>Who can use Bluebook to back up contacts?</h1>
<p>Anyone with an O2 mobile (as long as it&#39;s compatible with Bluebook). It won&#39;t work if you&#39;re on O2 One number, or with Brite or Tesco mobile.</p>

<p>Nothing. It&#39;s free unless you go abroad. You&#39;ll be charged  for data  use when you&#39;re out of the country. Check the terms and conditions for more information.</p>

<h1>What is my Bluebook username?</h1>

<h1>What is my Bluebook password? </h1>
<p>Your Bluebook password is always the same as your o2.co.uk password.</p>

<h1>What should I do if I get synchronisation failed?</h1>
